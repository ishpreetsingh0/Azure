ls : ls lists the contents of your current directory or the directory specified in an argument to the command.

Files and directories whose names begin with a period are hidden by default. To include these items in a directory listing, use an -a flag:
ls -a

To get even more information about the files and directories in the current directory, use an -l flag:
ls -l

cat command
Suppose you want to see what's inside a file. You can use the cat command for that.

sudo command
Some Bash commands can only be run by the root user; a system administrator or superuser
