Azure cloud shell :
is browser-accessible command-line experience for managing Azure resources.
provides cloud storage to persist files such as SSH keys, scripts, and more.
 CloudDrive or File Share keeps your uploaded files or created one during a session. 
You can use Azure Cloud Shell to:

Open a secure command-line session from any browser-based device.
Interact with Azure resources without the need to install plug-ins or add-ons to your device.
Persist files between sessions for later use.
Use either Bash or PowerShell, whichever you prefer, to manage Azure resources.
Edit files (such as scripts) via the Cloud Shell editor.
You shouldn't use Azure Cloud Shell if:

You intend to leave a session open for more than 20 minutes for long running scripts or activities. In these cases, your session is disconnected without warning, and the current state is lost.
You need admin permissions, such as sudo access, from within the Azure CLI or PowerShell environment.
You need to install tools that aren't supported in the limited Cloud Shell environment, but instead require an environment such as a custom virtual machine or container.
You need storage from different regions. You might need to back up and synchronize this content since only one region can have the storage allocated to Azure Cloud Shell.
You need to open multiple sessions at the same time. Azure Cloud Shell allows only one instance at time and isn't suitable for concurrent work across multiple subscriptions or tenants.
